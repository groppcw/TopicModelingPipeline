* Run PLDA+ on raw text data, and analyze results.

This directory contains scripts which will run PLDA+ on a given corpus of raw text data. Simply modify the settings file to contain the location where your data is located, and run the scripts in numbered order. These scripts will convert the data into the input format used by PLDA+ and extract other information needed by later scripts, run PLDA+ on the data, and perform post-processing to gather useful information from the run. This includes generating top words for each topic, and calculating perplexity.
