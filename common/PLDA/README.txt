# PLDA+ execution and post processing

These scripts execute PLDA+ and clean up its output. Please note that you will need a working install of PLDA+ for this; this can be downloaded from https://code.google.com/archive/p/plda/downloads . Do note that the 2013 version of PLDA+ linked on that page contains a makefile that requires repair to run on most machines; simply delete the make target "lda" and the lines that attempt to compile it, since this version does not come packaged with that source code.
