# TopicModelingPipeline
A collection of scripts used in the topic modeling pipeline at Clemson's DICE lab.

These scripts are organized into several folders, each representing a particular project or application. They draw upon a common basis of scripts that perform the data manipulation and formatting necessary to connect disparate pieces of code. Each method or project directory will have a readme file providing further detail on how to use it, but they follow the general format of containing a number of scripts that are intended to be run in numbered order, and a settings file where you can specify method parameters.
